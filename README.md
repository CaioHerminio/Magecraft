<h1>üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èMagecraft University ‚Äì Project 1 of The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>While diving into programming, I noticed how many beginners (my past self included) struggle with jumping into advanced topics without a solid foundation. I wanted to build something fun, progressive, and narrative-driven that combines storytelling, creativity, and code.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>My goal was to create an introductory project focused on variables and data types, using a simple but magical narrative. I also wanted it to be easy to replicate in different languages.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>I developed Magecraft University, a small character generator that asks the user for a few details (like color, animal, and a number) to generate a magical alias and assign a mana level. It‚Äôs a light and accessible way to introduce programming basics in multiple languages.</p>

<h3>Result</h3>
<p>This project serves as the first milestone in a larger personal learning path called The Code Fool‚Äôs Journey ‚Äî a series of 22 projects inspired by the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each stage builds on the last and is implemented in the three languages I'm studying now. The idea is to create a useful roadmap for myself, that I hope can be useful for other self-taught students and educators who value gamified learning methods.</p>

<h2>Multi-Language Learning Philosophy</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm learning Python, JavaScript, and C++ at the same time because I want to avoid becoming overly dependent on a single language‚Äôs syntax, which is what happened when I got used to Python and was shocked to notice how other languages ‚Äã‚Äãrequired more lines to do the same things. By practicing different languages side by side, I‚Äôm focusing on the true essence of programming ‚Äî logic, structure, and problem-solving, which are universal no matter the language. This project was implemented in all three languages to reinforce that point, and to allow others to compare how similar logic can be expressed in different syntaxes.</p>

<h2>Project Scope: Magecraft University</h2>
<p>Core concepts covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Variables</li>
  <li>Data types</li>
  <li>User input</li>
  <li>Foormatted output</li>
</ul>

<h1>About the Code Fool's Journey</h1>
<p>The Fool's Journey is similar to Joseph Campbell‚Äôs famous Hero‚Äôs Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22 stages, based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal power, just like programmers and artists. Here, each project increases in complexity and covered concepts, from simple variables and data types to APIs, Memory Management, Databases and GUI.</p>

<h1>Feel Free to Fork the Journey</h1>
<p>If you find this helpful for learning or teaching, you're welcome to fork, improve, or remix it in your own way. The Fool‚Äôs path is yours to walk ‚Äî and code ‚Äî however you like.üòä</p>
