  <h1>🧙‍♂️ The Code Fool's Journey</h1>

  <p><strong>The Fool's Journey</strong> is similar to Joseph Campbell’s famous Hero’s Journey, but instead of 12 stages, it follows 22—based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. Each card represents an archetype in the evolution of the protagonist, the Fool, who embarks on a path toward knowledge and personal growth.</p>

  <h2>💻 My Project</h2>
  <p>Inspired by this narrative, I’m creating <strong>The Code Fool's Journey</strong> — a series of 22 programming projects, each representing a stage in the Fool’s path. These projects are written in the programming languages I’m currently studying, primarily <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>.</p>

  <h2>📈 The Evolution</h2>
  <p>Each project builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity. The idea is to learn progressively, mastering each concept before moving on to the next. This approach helps prevent the frustration of trying to solve problems beyond our current understanding, and offers a solid roadmap for self-taught learners or educators who value practical, cross-language projects as learning tools.</p>

  <h2>🧪 Magecraft (Project 1)</h2>
  <p><strong>Magecraft</strong> is the first project in the journey. Its focus is on <strong>variables and data types</strong>. It's a simple character generator that uses user input to create a magical alias and assign a mana level. Though small in scope, it lays a foundational skillset that will be essential throughout the rest of the journey.</p>

  <h2>🌱 Recommendation</h2>
  <p>If this project proves helpful for your learning or teaching, feel free to <strong>modify</strong>, <strong>improve</strong>, or <strong>simplify</strong> it to suit your needs. The Fool’s path is yours to walk in your own way.</p>
